# VRKitchen
>Before starting my dissertation project to build a framework for kids games, I created a beta version of the VR Kitchen in Unity, to support on-going research at UofG.

>The research is about helping patients with Acquired Brain Injury to perform daily tasks using a virtual environment before being discharged into the real world.

>The complete application was developed within a week (14 - 21 June) and this was my first Unity/C# project.
